The `action-validator` is a standalone tool designed to "lint" the YAML files
used to define GitHub Actions and Workflows.  It ensures that they are well-formed,
by checking them against published JSON schemas, and it makes sure that any
globs used in `paths` / `paths-ignore` match at least one file in the repo.

The intended use case for `action-validator` is in Git pre-commit hooks and
similar situations.


# Installation

The [GitHub releases](https://github.com/mpalmer/action-validator/releases)
have some pre-built binaries -- just download and put them in your path.  If a
binary for your platform isn't available, let me know and I'll see what I can
figure out.  If you want to build locally, you'll need to install a
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) toolchain and then run `cargo build`.


## Using asdf

If you're a proponent of the [asdf tool](https://asdf-vm.com/), then you can
use that to install and manage `action-validator`:

```shell
asdf plugin add action-validator
# or
asdf plugin add action-validator https://github.com/mpalmer/action-validator.git
```

Install/configure action-validator:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all action-validator

# Install specific version
asdf install action-validator latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global action-validator latest

# Now action-validator commands are available
action-validator --version
```

The action-validator can be run in a Github action itself, as a pull request job. See the [test github action](.github/workflows/test.yml), in this repository, as an example of how to use action-validator + asdf in a GitHub workflow.

# Usage

Couldn't be simpler: just pass a file to the program:

```shell
action-validator .github/workflows/build.yml
```

Use `action-validator -h` to see additional options.

> ### CAUTION
>
> As the intended use-case for `action-validator` is in pre-commit hooks,
> it assumes that it is being run from the root of the repository.  Glob
> checking will explode horribly if you run it from a sub-directory of the
> repo -- or, heaven forfend, outside the repository entirely.
